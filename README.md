# Formal Languages and Finite Automata Laboratory Works #

Repository with all laboratory work assignments from FAF.LFPC21.1, a course about Formal Languages and Finite Automata.
<br>The main objective of the course is to introduce the fundamental notions about formal languages  and understand the mechanisms governing the analysis and synthesis of programming languages.
